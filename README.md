# raphtory_cloud

This is a repository used for storing the various scripts, applications, general code, and documentation for my Master Thesis.

The objective is to deploy the graph processing tool Raphtory in Google Cloud, using Kubernetes. It will also contain some experimentation with Cloud Buckets, and Docker.
